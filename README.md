# Ursine

A theme for the wonderful [Typora](https://typora.io), inspired by [Bear](https://bear.app)'s colors and elegancy.

![thumbnail](images/thumbnail.png)

Uses *Avenir Next LT Pro* and *Adelle* fonts, & the colors are based on Bear's *Red Graphite* and *Dark Graphite* themes.

Code fence themes are adapted from CodeMirror's *3024 Day* and *Dracula* themes for Ursine Polar and Umbra, respectively.

> Note: These themes have been designed and tested for both **MacOS & Windows** (though primarily Mac).

## Installation

> 注意：我对这个主题的修改并没有修改SASS源码，而是直接修改了CSS样式。出于开源协议我保留了这个仓库。
>
> 因此，实际上的安装步骤为：
>
> 1. 打开Typora-主题-打开主题文件夹。
> 2. 把`my-release`文件夹中的所有复制到Typora的`theme`文件夹中。

Decompress the latest release from [here](https://github.com/aCluelessDanny/typora-theme-ursine/releases). In Typora's preferences windows, go to `General -> Themes` and click on `Open Theme Folder`. Drop all the decompressed files and folders in there, and enjoy!~

*Note:* If you require using Cyrillic-compatible fonts, then download the Cyrillic variant found in the release instead.

## Build

Ursine has recently switched to developing in [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/), so the repo no longer holds the direct CSS files for the sake of keeping the repo's filetree clean.

If you wish to manually build the theme (and maybe add your own touches in the process), you'll need `npm` & run the following commands:

```bash
npm i
gulp
```

The compiled CSS files will be located in `/css` once complete.
